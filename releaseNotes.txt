	* New switch "-t productionID" (tag) has been added to be able to change the name of the data processing production ID. The default value is "barsv051" other common option is "r01_i01_j01_t01"

20.11.2019 - git commit d0292fc96f7f60b4cb176654feaee6db1f1547dc

	* In downloadJoint and downloadJointAllRuns added also download of the qcalib file from Zhenya's DQM
	* Qcalib is read from h0XXX.qcalib file and if qcalib constant is -1 it is assumed that the OM is not working
	* CloseHitsFilter is now based on the qcalib and not on the h_nHitsOM
	* start time of the run is newly taken from the fifth header entry since there are runs where the first two entries have zero values

	* src/config.rc is now used as a default option for processAllRuns script
	* changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* change in the calculation of the closeHits. Now also the first lower layer of OMs is taken into account when the closest OMs are calculated

	* New switch "-w eventID" was added which enables to produce only single visualization of the event with given ID without any fitting. Very useful for the verification of the reconstructed cascades by someone else.
	* The first fit after QFilter was changed from chi2 to MEstimator (ANATERES) which is much more stable for low Qcut values
	* values returned from chi2 as well as MEstimator are newly divided by NDF
	* the histogram h_nHitOM which is used for the closeHits filter is newly correctly filled before the main event loop which makes the whole procedure slower but better
	* the implementation of the gBranchCut was corrected
	* number of close hits in the closeHitsFilter has been changed from 10 to 6
	* multiple changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* start time of the run is now extracted from the second header entry since some of the runs have the first entry equal 0
