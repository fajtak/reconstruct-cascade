	* SetFCN(chi2) added before the first fit

06.01.2019 - git commit 5de116f1f39ea6afe1c0239300e9856d28edb4f4
	* new switch "a" to process Zhan-Arys MC cascades
	* values in the config.rc changed and branchCut and likelihoodCut values added
	* in studyReconstructedMCCascades.C script added a new histograms for position mismatch
	* added config file configDZH.rc for processing of the simulated cascades
	* logLikelihood fitting CORRECTED!!!
	* the first fit in the chain is again chi2
	* to guess initial fitiing time and position a grid of positions around detector are tested and value with smallest chi2 is used.
	* added all the filters for MCcascades
	* New file with MCcascade geometry added array2016_phys_kebkal.dat

11.12.2019 - git commit beab71ada52335628d4c038c20800208197f2902
	* new switch "u" to process MC single up-going atmospheric neutrinos
	* added two new bash scripts to download and read MC single up-going atmospheric neutrinos (downloadDataNu and readMCNu)
	* added function OMIDAlreadyInGPulses for MC data

10.12.2019 - git commit 45278b764bf40181994348579a0ee4cec64fa917
	* Huge extension of the whole program. Now MC atmospheric muon bundles can be read and cascades created on the muon tracks can be studied.
	* Added switch -m with no argument which enables to process MC data
	* Now the charge of all the pulses is calibrated -> QCut has to be set in p.e.
	* Added two bash scripts downloadMCData and readMC that downloads MC data and transforms them from wout to root structure
	* Added root script studyReconstructedMCCascades.C to study reconstructed MC cascades where all the parameters are known
	* g_pulses now have MCflag member that tels you the origin of the hit
	* scattering correction and Log(Q) removed from ExpectedTime -> It will be studied in the future
	* all the filters has been replicated to be able to work with BEvents from MC simulations
	* output of the program has been extended for RunInfo. Now the number of entries and time duration of the run is printed


04.12.2019 - git commit 3a305382d6f026cf422822e9ddd05ce7a577974a
	* Minor corrections

03.12.2019 - git commit 9f1a0d6847b07ca5d7a3e7136dba78e313a14401

	* default value of the LikelihoodCut increased from 2 -> 2.5
	* studyReconstructedCascades.C extended significantly. Now it shows also reconstructed energy and theta and also energy and TFilterHits cuts are used
	* TMultiGraphs in charge and event visualizations have axis labels now
	* existence of the 4D logLikelihood table is checked

29.11.2019 - git commit 3249e8e195299ca1276254f504876cef53d3f0fb
	
	* Loglikelihood for direction and energy reconstruction added
	* 4D pdf table is read
	* 8 string graphs with measured and expected charges are created

22.11.2019 - git commit 47fc8ce4b17b7e12e5ab351a816b852ac311ec7c

	* New switch "-t productionID" (tag) has been added to be able to change the name of the data processing production ID. The default value is "barsv051" other common option is "r01_i01_j01_t01"

20.11.2019 - git commit d0292fc96f7f60b4cb176654feaee6db1f1547dc

	* In downloadJoint and downloadJointAllRuns added also download of the qcalib file from Zhenya's DQM
	* Qcalib is read from h0XXX.qcalib file and if qcalib constant is -1 it is assumed that the OM is not working
	* CloseHitsFilter is now based on the qcalib and not on the h_nHitsOM
	* start time of the run is newly taken from the fifth header entry since there are runs where the first two entries have zero values

19.11.2019 - git commit db5a086f8e6ea6feec34a087b8a9e54c1963ae50

	* src/config.rc is now used as a default option for processAllRuns script
	* changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* change in the calculation of the closeHits. Now also the first lower layer of OMs is taken into account when the closest OMs are calculated

19.11.2019 - git commit 48cc8136f96c177ecfded97b66ae4aac036d12db

	* New switch "-w eventID" was added which enables to produce only single visualization of the event with given ID without any fitting. Very useful for the verification of the reconstructed cascades by someone else.
	* The first fit after QFilter was changed from chi2 to MEstimator (ANATERES) which is much more stable for low Qcut values
	* values returned from chi2 as well as MEstimator are newly divided by NDF
	* the histogram h_nHitOM which is used for the closeHits filter is newly correctly filled before the main event loop which makes the whole procedure slower but better
	* the implementation of the gBranchCut was corrected
	* number of close hits in the closeHitsFilter has been changed from 10 to 6
	* multiple changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* start time of the run is now extracted from the second header entry since some of the runs have the first entry equal 0
