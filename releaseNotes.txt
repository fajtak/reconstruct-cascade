	* Minor corrections

03.12.2019 - git commit 9f1a0d6847b07ca5d7a3e7136dba78e313a14401

	* default value of the LikelihoodCut increased from 2 -> 2.5
	* studyReconstructedCascades.C extended significantly. Now it shows also reconstructed energy and theta and also energy and TFilterHits cuts are used
	* TMultiGraphs in charge and event visualizations have axis labels now
	* existence of the 4D logLikelihood table is checked

29.11.2019 - git commit 3249e8e195299ca1276254f504876cef53d3f0fb
	
	* Loglikelihood for direction and energy reconstruction added
	* 4D pdf table is read
	* 8 string graphs with measured and expected charges are created

22.11.2019 - git commit 47fc8ce4b17b7e12e5ab351a816b852ac311ec7c

	* New switch "-t productionID" (tag) has been added to be able to change the name of the data processing production ID. The default value is "barsv051" other common option is "r01_i01_j01_t01"

20.11.2019 - git commit d0292fc96f7f60b4cb176654feaee6db1f1547dc

	* In downloadJoint and downloadJointAllRuns added also download of the qcalib file from Zhenya's DQM
	* Qcalib is read from h0XXX.qcalib file and if qcalib constant is -1 it is assumed that the OM is not working
	* CloseHitsFilter is now based on the qcalib and not on the h_nHitsOM
	* start time of the run is newly taken from the fifth header entry since there are runs where the first two entries have zero values

19.11.2019 - git commit db5a086f8e6ea6feec34a087b8a9e54c1963ae50

	* src/config.rc is now used as a default option for processAllRuns script
	* changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* change in the calculation of the closeHits. Now also the first lower layer of OMs is taken into account when the closest OMs are calculated

19.11.2019 - git commit 48cc8136f96c177ecfded97b66ae4aac036d12db

	* New switch "-w eventID" was added which enables to produce only single visualization of the event with given ID without any fitting. Very useful for the verification of the reconstructed cascades by someone else.
	* The first fit after QFilter was changed from chi2 to MEstimator (ANATERES) which is much more stable for low Qcut values
	* values returned from chi2 as well as MEstimator are newly divided by NDF
	* the histogram h_nHitOM which is used for the closeHits filter is newly correctly filled before the main event loop which makes the whole procedure slower but better
	* the implementation of the gBranchCut was corrected
	* number of close hits in the closeHitsFilter has been changed from 10 to 6
	* multiple changes in the values of the cut variables saved in src/config.rc
	* start time of the run is now extracted from the second header entry since some of the runs have the first entry equal 0
